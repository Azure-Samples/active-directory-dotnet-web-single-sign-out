## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a .NET 4.5 Web App (MVC) application calling a ASP.NET Web API that is secured using Azure Active Directory.

1. The .Net TodoListClient .NET 4.5 Web App (MVC) application uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the ASP.NET Web API.

### Scenario

> Describe the scenario
> Insert a screen copy of the client

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload)
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone `

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet pacakges, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are one projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps in the paragraphs below ([Step 2](#step-2--register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3](#step-3--configure-the-sample-to-use-your-azure-ad-tenant))
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** create for you the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies)
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation, read the instructions in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

#### First step: choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, click on your account, and then on **Switch Directory**.
1. Once the *Directory + subscription* pane opens, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application, from the *Favorites* or *All Directories* list.
1. Click on **All services** in the left-hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.

> In the next steps, you might need the tenant name (or directory name) or the tenant ID (or directory ID). These are presented in the **Properties**
of the Azure Active Directory window respectively as *Name* and *Directory ID*

#### Register the service app (WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet)

1. In the  **Azure Active Directory** pane, click on **App registrations** and choose **New application registration**.
1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet' and select 'Web app / API' as the *Application Type*.
1. For the *Sign-on URL*, enter the base URL for the sample. By default, this sample uses `https://localhost:44308/`.
1. Click **Create** to create the application.
1. In the succeeding page, Find the *Application ID* value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Then click on **Settings**, and choose **Properties**.
1. For the App ID URI, replace the guid in the generated URI 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/\<guid\>', with the name of your service, for example, 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet' (replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant)
1. From the **Settings** | **Reply URLs** page for your application, update the Reply URL for the application to be `https://localhost:44308/`
1. For **Logout URL**, provide the value `https://localhost:44308/Account/EndSession`
1. From the Settings menu, choose **Keys** and add a new entry in the Password section:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you save this page, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. Configure Permissions for your application. To that extent, in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section and then,
   click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type `Microsoft Graph` in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select **User.Read**.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the service project

1. Open the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet\Web.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri` and replace the existing value with the base address of the WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet project (by default `https://localhost:44308/`).

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Create a resource** in the top left-hand corner, select **Web + Mobile** --> **Web App**, select the hosting plan and region, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.  Click Create Web Site.
3. Once the web site is created, click on it to manage it.  For this set of steps, download the publish profile by clicking **Get publish profile** and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
4. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
5. Click on **Settings** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is https, for example [https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click Next.
6. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
7. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet`

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant containing the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet` application.
1. On the applications tab, select the `WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet` application.
1. In the **Settings** | page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the Settings -> Reply URLs menu, update the Sign-On URL, and Reply URL fields to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-DistributedSignOut-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.

> NOTE: Remember, the To Do list is stored in memory in this TodoListService sample. Azure Web Sites will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and your To Do list will get emptied.
Also, if you increase the instance count of the web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. To Do will, therefore, not be the same on each instance.
